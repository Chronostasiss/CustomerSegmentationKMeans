Customer Data Segmentation with K-means Clustering

Customer segmentation is a crucial task in marketing and business strategy, aimed at dividing a customer base into groups with similar characteristics and behaviors. This project implements customer segmentation using the K-means clustering algorithm to group customers based on their purchasing behavior.
How it Works

    Data Preprocessing: The first step involves preprocessing the customer data, including cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering. The dataset contains various features such as customer ID, age, gender, annual income, and spending score.

    Feature Selection: Depending on the specific business objectives, relevant features are selected for segmentation. In this case, features related to purchasing behavior, such as annual income and spending score, are chosen for clustering.

    K-means Clustering: The selected features are then used as input to the K-means clustering algorithm. K-means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that partitions the data into K clusters based on similarity in feature space. The algorithm iteratively assigns data points to the nearest cluster centroid and updates the centroids until convergence.

    Interpretation and Analysis: After clustering, the resulting segments are analyzed and interpreted to gain insights into customer behavior. This may involve visualizing the clusters, examining cluster centroids, and comparing segment characteristics.

Purpose

    Data Exploration: Explore the dataset to understand its structure, features, and distribution.
    Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the data by cleaning missing values, normalizing features, and encoding categorical variables if necessary.
    Feature Selection: Select relevant features for segmentation, such as those related to purchasing behavior.
    Model Training: Train the K-means clustering model using the selected features.
    Segmentation: Use the trained model to segment the customer data into clusters based on purchasing behavior.
    Analysis and Interpretation: Analyze the resulting clusters to understand customer segments and their characteristics.
